# SketchRecognition624_FinalProject
 The aim of this project is to develop a data augmentation algorithm that simulates the random jitter that occurs during handwriting. This algorithm is  used to generate new, augmented data based on a small subset of the original data. The goal of this work is to improve the generalization performance of machine learning models by providing them with additional, artificially generated training examples.
